# Portfolio Carlos Gonzalez

## Description

Building my coding portfolio from scratch helped me apply the HTML and CSS knowledge I have acquired in the previous month. This website works as a host for my future projects and collaborations. I learned the importance of understanding parenting in the coding structure. This will help the website and code be more clear for future updates.
