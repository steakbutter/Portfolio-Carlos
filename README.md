# Portfolio Carlos Gonzalez

## Description

Building my coding portfolio from scratch helped me apply the HTML and CSS knowledge I have acquired in the previous month. This website opens the door for my future portfolio and projects. I learned that understanding parenting in the coding structure will help the website and code be more clear for future modifications.
